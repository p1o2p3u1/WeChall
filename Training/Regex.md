# Regex Training Challenge (Level 1)
Your objective in this challenge is to learn the regex syntax.
Regular Expressions are a powerful tool in your way to master programming, so you should be able to solve this challenge, at least!
The solution to every task is always the shortest regular expression pattern possible.
Also note that you have to submit delimiters in the patterns too. Example pattern: /joe/i. The delimiter has to be /

Your first lesson is easy: submit the regular expression the matches an empty string, and only an empty string.

## Solution
```
/^$/
```
# Regex Training Challenge (Level 2)
Easy enough. Your next task is to submit a regular expression that matches only the string 'wechall' without quotes.

## Solution

```
/^wechall$/
```

# Regex Training Challenge (Level 3)

Ok, matching static strings is not the main goal of regular expressions.
Your next task is to submit an expression that matches valid filenames for certain images.
Your pattern shall match all images with the name wechall.ext or wechall4.ext and a valid image extension.
Valid image extensions are .jpg, .gif, .tiff, .bmp and .png.
Here are some examples for valid filenames: wechall4.tiff, wechall.png, wechall4.jpg, wechall.bmp

## Solution

```

```
